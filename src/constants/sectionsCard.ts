  history:
    "The Bus Stop Section was founded in 1982, about 40 years ago, during the presidency of Mr. I.K Afe. The section gained popularity quickly and congregated as an informal group around 1981, before being officially recognized as a formal section in 1982. At that time, air-conditioned lounges and bars were a privilege that most sections and the main club building did not enjoy. However, the Bus Stop's cold room housed the first air-conditioned lounge and the club's first digital TV decoder. Credit must be given to the past president and diamond member of Benin Club 1931, St. Davis Elaiho JP (THE LIVING SAINT), a founding member of the section who single-handedly wrote the letter of recognition for Bus Stop and facilitated its approval as a formal section.",
  history2:
    "Engr. Gabriel Osemekhian, a founding member and a history custodian of the section, Barr. Austin Okwechime, a founding member and the first Chief of Protocol, Past President Sonny Akpata, also a founding member and a three-time chairman of the section, and Mr. Emeka Amanfo, a sales / marketing executive with the UAC Group who was attached to the MDS unit (Manufacturers Delivery Services), also played critical roles in convincing club members across various sections to embrace this new budding group. \n Over the years, the Bus Stop Section has been known as the heartbeat, intellectual, and conscience of the club. Traditionally, the captain of the section is referred to as the Chairman, and the Bus Stop Section is the only section without any sport activities. The section conducts the annual Manifesto Night that precedes its elections, arranges visits to orphanage homes to share palliatives and be a part of their challenges, and organizes lectures to discuss contemporary national issues and more. \n Since inception, the section has had 17 chairmen, including Chief Jim Ovbude, Chief J. Ikikiru, Mr. John Omo, Mr. Ian Forster, Mr. Jimoral, Chief J.B. Momoh, Mr. Paul Oseh, Mr. Harris Unuigbe, Mr. Sonny Akpata, Mr. Sam Ekezie, Alh. Lawan Bala Issa, Barr. Jefferson Uwoghiren, Mr. Justin Ofili, Prof. Edoba Omoregie, Mr. Ik Osunbor, Barr. Lucky Ayomoto, and our current chairman, Mr. Sunny Omonzokpia. The section also has a Grand Patron Hon. Rasak Bello Osagie and 13 Patrons, including St. Davis Elaiho JP, Mr. Victor Ikponmwanba, Dr. Omoregie Ukponmwan, Mr. Moses Aroko, Mr. Sam Ekezie, Hon. Charles Idahosa, Mr. Collins Ehinebo, Diokpa Justin Ofili, Mr. Frank Ize-Iyamu, Barr. Jefferson Uwoghiren, Barr. Lucky Ayomoto, Chief Isaac Ikekhuame JP, and Engr. Steve Ayiyi. \n The section is known for recognizing and rewarding hardworking personnel accordingly, as seen in the case of the immediate Past President, Pharm Fred Iboi, who was awarded the Millennium Achievers Awards and Bus Stop Ambassador of Change for his tremendous developmental strides in leaps and bounds across the entire club. While not a member of the Bus Stop Section, Pharm Fred Iboi's vision aligns with the ideals of the section, and the members are proud of his accomplishments. Similarly, Chris Uba was rewarded for his efficient running and management of the Benin Club bar, which resulted in the highest bar sales in the history of the club in the year 2022. The Bus Stop Section of the Benin Club 1931 remains a noble section that upholds the values of selflessness and recognizes hard work and dedication.",
