  history:
    'Leisure and Indoor Games Section was founded officially 10 years ago (2012) by a group of dynamic young gentlemen from different background and profession, who at the material time were enthusiast of board games such as Chess, Scrabble, Whot, Monopoly, Draft and other leisure games and couldn’t find a section to accommodate the playing of such games within the province of Benin club. Sequel to the inauguration of Aso Rock as a section, these gentlemen use to gather after close of work at the upper lounge of Benin club to regularly participate in these games above mentioned, prominent amongst this Gentlemen are Arc. Perry Onah, our inaugural Captain, Mr. Nyamali Femi popularly called Baba Femo (Patron), Mr. Taju lawal Former Vice President Benin Club, Sir. Okon Iyang (Captain Emeritus 2nd), Barr. David Maduku (Captain Emeritus 3rd) Engr. Godslove Iserhien (A. k. A Ozidi Congo), Uyi Owie, Idowu Edebiri and so many others, to further foster the co jovial atmosphere in which this games were played every other evening, some members of this group provided a T. V while Baba Femo (Patron) single handedly provided a music Box. ',
  history2:
    'This particular spot of the Upper Lounge of Benin Club became sort of a mecca to young professionals who are members of Benin Club after close of work. The unity and civility in which these games were played on daily bases, attracted the attention of the then president of Benin Club, Chief Sam Iredia of blessed memory , who became a regular participant himself, he also took the young men under his wing as a guardian, so as time went by when he was approached by some members of this group to approved a section to be called Leisure and Indoor Games Section and he willingly gave his approval and ensure a space was carved out for the section during renovation and because of the bond between the then President of Benin Club and our young section, our very own dear Taju Lawal who coincidentally was the then vice President of Benin Club nick named the section Aso Rock, which has come to stay till this day, my brothers the benevolence of chief Sam Iredia of blessed memory towards us during our formative years shall never be forgotten, I say may his soul continue to rest in peace.  Over the years Aso Rock has become more than a section to some of us, it has become a brotherhood, the unity and love that abide in Aso Rock can hardly be experience anywhere else, I say this because I am a benefactor of this love and unity of Aso Rock. Just recently I aspire for a seat at the federal House of representative via my political party the PDP and we were called to contest the primaries impromptu, I find myself in dire need of security, transportation for my supporters and so many other logistics problem that comes with the conduct of election, with just a phone call to members of Aso Rock, members brought their personal vehicles to convey people to the venue, members gave me the personal police attaché to act as my security more than 40 members of our section was present at the venue under rain campaigning for my candidature, to me that is what is called a miracle.  These acts of kindness is not limited to me alone, in the time past our section has gifted a car to an age member of Benin club whose vehicle was broken down, Aso Rock regularly donate cash and other provisions to several orphanage homes within Benin metropolis and beyond, just this week in the spirit of our 10years and thankful celebration, we visited Orosanye and Bethel Ophanage homes wherein we donated several provision to both orphanage homes, we also paid a visit to the Government hospital close to Benin Club and gave all the patient within the hospital money to ease their hospital bill.  In business we believe in lifting each other up first, our patronage amongst ourselves cannot be quantified, within 10years of our existence many members that joined the section without their personal building has become landlord, myself inclusive because we were inspired by members before us to do so. May God continue to bless the spirit of umbutu amongst us. ',
